            <h4>Beyond being a Front-End Engineer, I am an avid musician, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brownandcrispy/" target="_blank">amateur baker.</a></h4>
                <div class="life-text">
                <p>
                    Since graduating from Syracuse University with a Bachelor's Degree in Music,
                    I've been fortunate enough to combine my passions for music, travel, and education by
                    working with organizations like Stanford University, SEA Semester, and Hult International Business School 
                    to give students a chance to see their world through a different lens. <br>
                    <br> You may be asking yourself how I found myself turning to code? 
                    When I was an intern at Harvard Business School Publishing, I had a mentor 
                    (who had a background as a flautist) who always said <q>"Musicians make for some of the best coders"</q>. 
                    I never really knew what this meant, but as someone who identifies as a musician, the phrase stuck with me for years to come.
                    
                    <br><br>After enrolling in a Python Course through Hult International Business School, I found
                    that coding made me think in a similar way to how I felt when I was reading sheet music,
                    or arranging the latest hits for my collegiate a cappella group,
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/4PiTmJ-Cra0?t=525" target="_blank">Otto Tunes</a>.
                    Fast forward a few months, and I found myself cracking open my laptop as soon as I finished
                    my day at work to keep working on a project, or to learn more about the many aspects of Front-End Engineering.
